# Wingspan: A Game of Avian Collection and Engine-Building

## Game Overview

Wingspan is a competitive, medium-weight, card-driven, engine-building board game designed by Elizabeth Hargrave and published by Stonemaier Games. Players take on the role of bird enthusiasts—researchers, bird watchers, ornithologists, and collectors—seeking to discover and attract the best birds to their network of wildlife preserves. Each bird extends a chain of powerful combinations in one of your habitats. These habitats focus on several key aspects of growth:

*   **Forest:** Gain food tokens
*   **Grassland:** Lay eggs
*   **Wetland:** Draw bird cards

## Objective

The primary objective in Wingspan is to accumulate the most points by the end of four rounds. Points are awarded for a variety of achievements, including:

*   **Birds:** Each bird card has an intrinsic point value.
*   **Bonus Cards:** Secret objectives that award points for specific combinations of birds or other conditions.
*   **End-of-Round Goals:** Public goals that reward players for having the most of a certain resource or condition in each round.
*   **Eggs:** Each egg laid on a bird card is worth one point.
*   **Cached Food:** Food tokens stored on certain bird cards are worth one point each.
*   **Tucked Cards:** Cards placed underneath certain bird cards are worth one point each.

## Victory Conditions

The player with the highest total score at the end of the game is declared the winner. In the case of a tie, the player with the most unused food tokens wins. If a tie still persists, the tied players share the victory.
