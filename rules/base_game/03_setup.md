# Wingspan Game Setup

This document provides a step-by-step guide to setting up a game of Wingspan.

## Initial Board and Component Setup

1.  **Goal Board:** Place the goal board in the center of the play area. Choose which side to use for scoring:
    *   **Green Side:** Players compete for 1st, 2nd, and 3rd place for each goal.
    *   **Blue Side:** Each player scores points based on the number of items they have that match the goal.
2.  **Goal Tiles:** Shuffle the eight goal tiles and place one randomly on each of the four spaces on the goal board.
3.  **Bird Cards:** Shuffle the deck of 170 bird cards and place it next to the play area.
4.  **Bird Tray:** Place the bird tray next to the bird card deck and draw the top three cards from the deck, placing them face-up on the tray.
5.  **Food Tokens and Eggs:** Create a general supply of food tokens and egg miniatures, placing them within easy reach of all players.
6.  **Birdfeeder:** Place the five custom food dice into the birdfeeder dice tower and roll them.

## Player Setup

Each player receives the following components:

1.  **Player Mat:** One player mat.
2.  **Action Cubes:** Eight action cubes of a single color.
3.  **Bird Cards:** Five bird cards drawn from the top of the deck.
4.  **Bonus Cards:** Two bonus cards drawn from the bonus card deck.
5.  **Food Tokens:** One of each of the five food types (invertebrate, seed, fish, fruit, and rodent).

## Initial Player Choices

Before the game begins, each player must make the following decisions:

1.  **Choose Bird Cards:** From the initial hand of five bird cards, each player may choose to keep any number of them. For each bird card kept, the player must discard one food token from their starting supply of five.
2.  **Choose Bonus Card:** From the two bonus cards drawn, each player must choose one to keep and discard the other. The kept bonus card remains a secret objective until the end of the game.

## Starting the Game

Once all players have made their initial choices, the player who most recently saw a bird is designated as the first player and receives the first player token. The game then proceeds in clockwise order.
