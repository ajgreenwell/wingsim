# Wingspan Game Structure

This document outlines the overall structure of a game of Wingspan, including the round and turn sequence.

## Game Rounds

A game of Wingspan is played over **four rounds**. The number of turns each player takes decreases with each round, as follows:

*   **Round 1:** 8 turns per player
*   **Round 2:** 7 turns per player
*   **Round 3:** 6 turns per player
*   **Round 4:** 5 turns per player

At the beginning of each round, players have all of their action cubes available to use. At the end of each round, players score the end-of-round goal, and the first player token is passed to the next player in clockwise order.

## Turn Sequence

During each round, players take turns in clockwise order, starting with the first player. On each turn, a player must perform **one of the four available actions** by placing an action cube on the leftmost available space in the corresponding habitat row on their player mat.

A player's turn consists of the following steps:

1.  **Choose an Action:** Select one of the four actions: Play a Bird, Gain Food, Lay Eggs, or Draw Cards.
2.  **Place Action Cube:** Place one action cube on the leftmost exposed slot of the chosen action's row on the player mat.
3.  **Gain Benefit:** Receive the benefit indicated by the chosen action slot.
4.  **Activate Bird Powers:** If the chosen action is Gain Food, Lay Eggs, or Draw Cards, move the action cube from right to left across the habitat row, activating any brown "WHEN ACTIVATED" powers on the bird cards in that row.
5.  **End of Turn:** The turn ends, and the action cube remains on the far left of the action row, marking that action space as unavailable for the remainder of the round. The cube stays in place until the end of the round.

## Action Cube Management

Each player starts each round with all of their action cubes available. As turns are taken, action cubes are placed on the player mat and remain there until the end of the round. This means that each player has progressively fewer action spaces available as the round continues. At the end of each round, all action cubes are removed from player mats and become available again for the next round.
