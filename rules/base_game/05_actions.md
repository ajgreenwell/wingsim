# The Four Actions of Wingspan

This document details the four primary actions a player can take on their turn in Wingspan.

## 1. Play a Bird

To play a bird card from your hand, you must place an action cube on the "Play a Bird" space on your player mat. You must then pay the bird's food cost and any applicable egg costs. The bird is then placed in the leftmost available slot of a matching habitat on your player mat. When a bird is played, any "WHEN PLAYED" powers are immediately activated.

## 2. Gain Food

To gain food, place an action cube on the leftmost available slot in the **Forest** habitat row. You will then gain the number of food dice indicated on that space from the birdfeeder. After gaining food, you may activate the brown "WHEN ACTIVATED" powers of any birds in your Forest habitat, moving from right to left.

## 3. Lay Eggs

To lay eggs, place an action cube on the leftmost available slot in the **Grassland** habitat row. You will then gain the number of eggs indicated on that space. These eggs can be placed on any of your bird cards, as long as you do not exceed the egg limit of each card. After laying eggs, you may activate the brown "WHEN ACTIVATED" powers of any birds in your Grassland habitat, moving from right to left.

## 4. Draw Cards

To draw bird cards, place an action cube on the leftmost available slot in the **Wetland** habitat row. You will then gain the number of bird cards indicated on that space. You may draw cards from either the face-up display on the bird tray or the top of the deck. After drawing cards, you may activate the brown "WHEN ACTIVATED" powers of any birds in your Wetland habitat, moving from right to left.
