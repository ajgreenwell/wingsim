# Playing Birds in Wingspan

This document explains the rules and costs associated with the "Play a Bird" action.

## Paying Bird Costs

When playing a bird card, you must be able to pay two potential costs:

1.  **Food Cost:** The food cost is indicated by the food icons in the upper-left corner of the bird card. You must discard the specified number and type of food tokens from your personal supply. A "wild" food icon can be paid with any food type. If a bird has no food icons, it has no food cost.
2.  **Egg Cost:** The cost to play a bird also depends on the column in which it is placed. 
    *   **Column 1:** No egg cost.
    *   **Columns 2 and 3:** 1 egg.
    *   **Columns 4 and 5:** 2 eggs.
    You must discard the required number of eggs from any of your birds with eggs.

## Placing Birds

Once the costs are paid, the bird card is placed in the **leftmost exposed slot** of a habitat that matches one of the habitat icons on the card. This means the first empty space in that habitat row, reading from left to right. If a bird card shows multiple habitats, you may choose which of those habitats to place it in. A maximum of five birds can be played in each habitat row.

## Activating "When Played" Powers

Some birds have a "WHEN PLAYED" power, indicated by white text with no colored background. This power is activated immediately upon playing the bird and does not activate again for the rest of the game.
