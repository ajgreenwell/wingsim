# The Food System in Wingspan

This document details the rules surrounding food acquisition and management in Wingspan.

## Food Types

There are five types of food in Wingspan, represented by cardboard tokens:

*   Invertebrate
*   Seed
*   Fish
*   Fruit
*   Rodent

## Gaining Food

The primary way to gain food is by taking the **Gain Food** action in the Forest habitat. The number of food dice you get to take from the birdfeeder is determined by the leftmost uncovered space in your Forest row. 

### The Birdfeeder

The birdfeeder is a dice tower that holds five custom food dice. The faces of the dice show the different food types. When you take the Gain Food action, you choose dice from the birdfeeder that show the food types you want. The chosen dice are removed from the birdfeeder and are not re-rolled until the birdfeeder is empty or all dice show the same face.

**Important:** When gaining food from the birdfeeder, if a power allows you to gain an invertebrate, you can use a die showing either the invertebrate side or the dual side. The same applies to seeds.

### Birdfeeder Reset Rules

The birdfeeder must be reset (all 5 dice thrown back in) under two conditions:

1.  **Empty Birdfeeder:** If the birdfeeder tray is ever completely empty, throw all 5 dice back into the birdfeeder.
2.  **All Same Face:** If all the dice in the tray show the same face (including if there is only 1 die remaining) and you are about to gain food for any reason, you may first throw all 5 dice back into the birdfeeder. Note that the dual die face counts as its own unique face for this purpose.

### Food from Bird Powers

Many bird cards have powers that allow you to gain food. These powers will specify whether you gain food from the birdfeeder (by removing a die) or directly from the general supply (without using the birdfeeder).

## Food Supply Management

The supply of food tokens is not intended to be limited. There is no maximum number of food tokens you can have next to your player mat or cached on your bird cards. In the unlikely event that any type of food token is unavailable in the supply, use a temporary substitute.

## Food Conversions

*   **Wild Food:** Some bird cards have a "wild" food icon in their cost, which can be paid with any type of food token.
*   **2-for-1 Exchange:** When playing a bird, you may exchange any two food tokens from your supply for one food token of a type that you need. This exchange can only be used when playing birds, not during other parts of the game.
*   **Card-to-Food Conversion:** When taking the Gain Food action, you may discard one bird card from your hand to gain one additional food die from the birdfeeder. This is optional and can only be done once per Gain Food action.
