# The Egg System in Wingspan

This document explains the rules for laying and managing eggs in Wingspan.

## Laying Eggs

The primary method for laying eggs is the **Lay Eggs** action in the Grassland habitat. The number of eggs you can lay is determined by the leftmost uncovered space in your Grassland row. These eggs can be placed on any of your bird cards, distributed as you see fit, as long as you do not exceed the egg limit for each individual bird.

### Egg Limits

Each bird card has an egg limit, indicated by the number of egg icons on the card. You cannot place more eggs on a bird than its egg limit allows.

### Eggs from Bird Powers

Certain bird powers also allow you to lay eggs. These powers will specify the conditions and the number of eggs that can be laid.

## Egg Conversions and Uses

*   **Food-to-Egg Conversion:** When taking the Lay Eggs action, you may pay one food token of any type to lay one additional egg.
*   **Paying Costs:** Eggs are used to pay the cost of playing birds in columns 2 through 5 of your player mat.

## Egg Supply Management

There is **no limit** to the egg supply. In the unlikely event that no eggs remain in the supply, use a temporary substitute.

## Excess Eggs

It is possible that you will have more capacity to lay eggs (based on your player mat) than you have spaces available on your birds. Any excess eggs beyond your birds' egg limits are lost and cannot be placed.

## Scoring Eggs

At the end of the game, each egg on your bird cards is worth **1 point**.
