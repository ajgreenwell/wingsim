# Drawing Cards in Wingspan

This document outlines the rules for drawing bird cards in Wingspan.

## The Draw Cards Action

The primary way to draw new bird cards is by taking the **Draw Cards** action in the Wetland habitat. The number of cards you can draw is determined by the leftmost uncovered space in your Wetland row. You can choose to draw cards from two sources:

*   **Face-up Bird Tray:** You may select any of the three face-up bird cards on the bird tray.
*   **Top of the Deck:** You may draw the top card from the shuffled bird card deck.

You may mix and match between these two sources. For example, if you are able to draw two cards, you could take one from the bird tray and one from the top of the deck.

### Hand Limit

There is **no limit** to the number of bird cards you can have in your hand at any time. Players may choose to keep their hands **private or public** throughout the game.

### Replenishing the Bird Tray

Face-up cards taken from the bird tray are **not immediately replaced**. The bird tray is only replenished at the end of a player's turn if any cards were taken. At the end of each round, all remaining face-up cards on the bird tray are discarded, and three new cards are drawn to replace them.

## Card Drawing from Bird Powers

Many bird powers also allow you to draw cards. These powers will specify the conditions and the number of cards you can draw.

## Egg-to-Card Conversion

When taking the Draw Cards action, you may discard one egg from one of your birds to draw one additional bird card.
