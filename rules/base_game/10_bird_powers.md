# Bird Powers in Wingspan

This document provides an overview of the different types of bird powers in Wingspan and when they are activated.

## Power Categories

Bird powers are categorized into three main types, distinguished by the color of the power's text box:

### 1. When Played (No Color)

Powers with no colored background are activated **only when the bird is played** from your hand onto your player mat. These powers do not activate again for the rest of the game.

### 2. When Activated (Brown)

Brown powers are activated when you take the corresponding habitat's action. After you gain the benefit of the action space, you move your action cube from right to left across the habitat row, activating the brown powers of each bird in that row in sequence. These are the powers that form the core of your engine-building strategy.

### 3. Once Between Turns (Pink)

Pink powers are activated on **your opponents' turns**. Each pink power can be used once between each of your turns. The trigger for a pink power is a specific action taken by an opponent, as described on the bird card.

**Activation Timing:**
Unless the card specifically says "at the end of the turn," pink powers activate **immediately** after the triggering action occurs. This can interrupt the active player's turn. For example, if an opponent's predator succeeds mid-turn, your pink power that triggers on this event activates right away, before the opponent continues activating their other brown powers.

Once you use a pink power, it cannot be used again until after you take your next turn. At the start of your turn, all of your pink powers reset and become available again.

If multiple players' pink powers are triggered by the same action, they are resolved in clockwise order, starting with the player to the left of the active player.
