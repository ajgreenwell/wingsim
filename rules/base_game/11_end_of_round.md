# End of Round Procedures

This document outlines the steps that occur at the end of each of the four rounds in Wingspan.

## End of Round Sequence

Once all players have used their available action cubes for the round, the following steps are performed in order:

1.  **Remove Action Cubes:** All players remove their action cubes from their player mats, making all action spaces available for the next round.

2.  **Score End-of-Round Goal:** In turn order, each player places one of their action cubes on the goal board to mark their score for the current round's goal. The placement of the cube depends on the side of the goal board being used:

    *   **Green Side:** Players determine their rank (1st, 2nd, or 3rd) based on who best met the goal. Ties are handled by adding the placement values of the tied positions and dividing by the number of tied players, rounded down. For example, if two players tie for 1st place, they each receive the points for 1st and 2nd place combined, divided by two (e.g., (5+2)/2 = 3.5, rounded down to 3 points each). No 2nd place is awarded in this case. Players who finish in 4th or 5th place score 0 points.

    *   **Blue Side:** Each player scores a set number of points for each item they have that matches the goal, up to a maximum of 5 points. The minimum is 0 points, but you must still place a cube on the goal board even if you score 0. You must have at least 1 of the targeted item to score any points.

3.  **Discard and Replenish Bird Tray:** All face-up bird cards on the bird tray are discarded. Three new cards are then drawn from the top of the deck and placed face-up on the tray.

4.  **Rotate First Player Token:** The first player token is passed to the next player in clockwise order. This player will be the first to take a turn in the next round.
