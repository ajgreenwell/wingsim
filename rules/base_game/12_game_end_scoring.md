# Game End and Final Scoring

This document explains the process of final scoring at the end of a game of Wingspan.

## End of the Game

The game ends after the completion of the fourth round, once all players have taken their final turns and the end-of-round goal for the fourth round has been scored.

## Final Scoring

Players calculate their final scores by summing the points from the following categories:

| Category              | Points                                                                                             |
| --------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Bird Cards**        | The point value printed on each bird card in the player's preserve.                                |
| **Bonus Cards**       | Points earned from the secret bonus card kept at the beginning of the game.                        |
| **End-of-Round Goals**| The total points awarded from the end-of-round goals, as indicated by the player's action cubes on the goal board. |
| **Eggs**              | 1 point for each egg miniature on a player's bird cards.                                           |
| **Cached Food**       | 1 point for each food token cached on a player's bird cards.                                       |
| **Tucked Cards**      | 1 point for each card tucked under a player's bird cards.                                          |

## Tiebreaker

If two or more players are tied for the highest score, the player with the most unused food tokens at the end of the game is the winner. If there is still a tie, the tied players share the victory.
