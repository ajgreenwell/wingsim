# Bird Powers: Food Gaining

This document details the various bird powers related to gaining food, with clarifications from the Wingspan Appendix.

## Food from the Birdfeeder

These powers allow players to take food dice from the birdfeeder.

| Bird(s) | Power | Trigger | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|
| Great Crested Flycatcher, Indigo Bunting, Rose-breasted Grosbeak, Western Tanager | Gain 1 [food type] from the birdfeeder, if there is one. | `WHEN ACTIVATED` | Standard food gain from the birdfeeder. |
| Bald Eagle, Northern Flicker | Gain all [food type] that are in the birdfeeder. | `WHEN PLAYED` | A powerful one-time effect. |
| Anna's Hummingbird, Ruby-throated Hummingbird | Each player gains 1 food from the birdfeeder, starting with the player of your choice. | `WHEN ACTIVATED` | The owner of the hummingbird decides which person gains the first food, and then players gain food in turn order. Players may reset the birdfeeder if it is empty or if all dice are showing the same face. |
| Hermit Thrush | Player(s) with fewest birds in the forest gain 1 food from the birdfeeder. | `WHEN ACTIVATED` | If multiple players are tied for the fewest birds in the forest, they all use this power. The owner of the Hermit Thrush chooses who goes first, and players proceed in turn order. |
| Black-billed Magpie, Black Vulture, Turkey Vulture | When another player's predator succeeds, gain 1 food from the birdfeeder. | `ONCE BETWEEN TURNS` | If multiple players trigger this power at the same time, they gain food in turn order, starting to the left of the active player (the one whose predator succeeded). |

## Food from the Supply

These powers allow players to take food directly from the general supply, without relying on the birdfeeder.

| Bird(s) | Power | Trigger | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|
| Blue-Gray Gnatcatcher, Northern Cardinal, Spotted Towhee, Yellow-bellied Sapsucker | Gain 1 [specific food] from the supply. | `WHEN ACTIVATED` | Direct gain from the supply. |
| American Goldfinch, Brown Pelican | Gain 3 [specific food] from the supply. | `WHEN PLAYED` | A strong one-time food gain. |
| Eastern Phoebe, Scissor-tailed Flycatcher, Osprey, Baltimore Oriole, Red Crossbill | All players gain 1 [specific food] from the supply. | `WHEN ACTIVATED` | A benefit for all players. |
| Green Heron | Trade 1 of any food for any other food from the supply. | `WHEN ACTIVATED` | A useful food conversion power. |
| American Crow, Black-crowned Night-Heron, Chihuahuan Raven, Common Raven, Fish Crow | Discard 1 egg from any of your other birds to gain 1 or 2 food from the supply. | `WHEN ACTIVATED` | These birds are all known for eating eggs from other birds' nests. You must have laid an egg on another bird before you can use these powers. Discard the egg to the supply. |
| Belted Kingfisher, Eastern Kingbird | When another player plays a bird in a specific habitat, gain 2 [specific food] from the supply. | `ONCE BETWEEN TURNS` | A bird that uses its power to move into the habitat does not trigger this power. |

## Caching Food

These powers allow birds to cache food, which is worth 1 point per token at the end of the game.

| Bird(s) | Power | Trigger | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|
| Carolina Chickadee, Juniper Titmouse, Mountain Chickadee, Red-breasted Nuthatch, White-breasted Nuthatch | Gain 1 invertebrate from the supply and cache it on this card. | `WHEN ACTIVATED` | The birds with these powers are known for caching extra food and saving it for later. As noted on these cards, you can cache exactly 1 food token when their power is activated by placing it on a bird card. Once a food token is cached on a bird card, you cannot spend it. Each token on the card at the end of the game is worth 1 point. |
| Acorn Woodpecker, Blue Jay, Clark's Nutcracker, Red-bellied Woodpecker, Red-headed Woodpecker, Steller's Jay | Gain 1 invertebrate from the birdfeeder (if available). You may cache it on this card. | `WHEN ACTIVATED` | If the same dice are showing in the birdfeeder, you may reroll to see if you meet the condition of the bird. If you run out of food tokens, you can cache cards instead. |
| Loggerhead Shrike | When another player takes the "gain food" action, if they gain any number of rodents, also gain 1 rodent from the supply and cache it on this card. | `ONCE BETWEEN TURNS` | This power triggers off an opponent's action. |
