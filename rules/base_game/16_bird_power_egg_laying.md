# Bird Powers: Egg Laying

This document details the various bird powers related to laying eggs, with clarifications from the Wingspan Appendix.

**General Rule:** Remember that each bird has an egg limit. No power allows you to lay more eggs on a bird than its limit allows. Star nest symbols are wild and can be used as all of the nest types. If you have different powers that are looking for specific nests, a bird with a star nest can be used with all of them, even within one turn.

## Nest Parasites

These birds lay their eggs in other birds' nests.

| Bird(s) | Power | Trigger | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|
| American Avocet, Barrow's Goldeneye, Bronzed Cowbird, Brown-headed Cowbird, Yellow-billed Cuckoo | When another player takes the "lay eggs" action, this bird lays 1 egg on another bird with a [specific type of] nest. | `ONCE BETWEEN TURNS` | These birds are all nest parasites in the wild; they lay eggs in other birds' nests. Cowbirds don't even build their own nests. When another player uses the grassland action to lay eggs, you may lay 1 egg. You may do this only once between your turns, no matter how many other players lay eggs. The cowbird can lay eggs on star nests. |

## "When Played" Egg-Laying Powers

These powers activate once when the bird is played.

| Bird(s) | Power | Trigger | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|
| Ash-throated Flycatcher, Bobolink, Inca Dove, Say's Phoebe | Lay 1 egg on each of your birds with a [nest type] nest. | `WHEN PLAYED` | This power allows you to lay eggs on all of your birds that have a specific nest symbol (and all birds with a star nest symbol), including the newly played bird. |

## "When Activated" Egg-Laying Powers

These powers activate when you use the action of the habitat they are in.

| Bird(s) | Power | Trigger | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|
| Pileated Woodpecker, Lazuli Bunting, Western Meadowlark | All players lay 1 egg on any 1 bird [with a specific nest]. You may lay 1 egg on 1 additional bird [of the same nest type]. | `WHEN ACTIVATED` | This power allows you to lay an egg on 1 or 2 birds with a specific nest symbol (or a star). All other players can lay an egg on 1 bird with that nest symbol (or a star), if they have one. |
| Grasshopper Sparrow, Baird's Sparrow, Cassin's Sparrow, Chipping Sparrow | Lay 1 egg on any bird. | `WHEN ACTIVATED` | A simple and direct egg-laying power. |
| California Quail, Mourning Dove, Northern Bobwhite | Lay 1 egg on this bird. | `WHEN ACTIVATED` | The egg must be laid on the bird with the power. |
