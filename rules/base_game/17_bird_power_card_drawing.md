# Bird Powers: Card Drawing

This document details the various bird powers related to drawing cards, with clarifications from the Wingspan Appendix.

**General Rule:** In general, draw cards into your hand as described on the card. Just as with the Draw Cards action, you may draw from the deck or the face-up cards. There is never any hand limit. Hands may be private or public. Face-up cards are refilled only at the end of your turn.

| Bird(s) | Power | Trigger | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|
| Mallard | Draw 1 card. | `WHEN ACTIVATED` | This power adds cards to the wetland’s draw card(s) action. You may draw from the deck or the face-up cards. |
| Black-necked Stilt, Carolina Wren | Draw 2 cards. | `WHEN PLAYED` | Face-up cards are refilled only at the end of your turn. |
| Black Tern, Clark's Grebe, Forster's Tern, Common Yellowthroat, Pied-billed Grebe, Ruddy Duck, Wood Duck | Draw 1 card. If you do, discard 1 card from your hand at the end of your turn. | `WHEN ACTIVATED` | This power adds cards to the wetland’s draw card(s) action, but it has a cost. The next player may start their turn while you are deciding which card(s) to discard. |
| Franklin's Gull, Killdeer | Discard 1 egg to draw 2 cards. | `WHEN ACTIVATED` | This power adds cards to the wetland’s draw card(s) action, but it has a cost. Discard an egg to the supply. You cannot use this power if you have not laid any eggs yet. |
| Northern Shoveler, Purple Gallinule, Spotted Sandpiper, Wilson's Snipe | All players draw 1 card from the deck. | `WHEN ACTIVATED` | Draw clockwise, starting with the current player. |
| American Bittern, Common Loon | Player(s) with the fewest birds in the wetland habitat, all draw a card, starting with you and proceeding clockwise. | `WHEN ACTIVATED` | If players are tied for the fewest birds currently in the wetland habitat, all draw a card. All may draw from the deck or the face-up cards. |
| American Oystercatcher | Draw cards equal to the number of players +1. Starting with you and proceeding clockwise, each player selects 1 of those cards and places it in their hand. You keep the extra card. | `WHEN PLAYED` | Draw the cards from the deck so that you have a set with one more card than there are players. Each player chooses one card from this set, starting with you and passing to the left. When everyone has chosen a card, you keep the extra card. |
