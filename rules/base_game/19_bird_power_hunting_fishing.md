# Bird Powers: Hunting and Fishing

This document details the various bird powers related to hunting and fishing. With these powers, birds go hunting for a smaller bird, a rodent, or a fish. If they find one, they keep it, and it counts as a point at the end of the game.

## Wingspan-Based Hunting

These birds hunt by comparing their hunting power to the wingspan of the top card of the deck.

| Bird(s) | Power | Trigger | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|
| Barred Owl, Cooper's Hawk, Golden Eagle, Great Horned Owl, Greater Roadrunner, Northern Harrier, Peregrine Falcon, Red-shouldered Hawk, Red-tailed Hawk, Swainson's Hawk | Look at a card from the deck. If it has a wingspan less than [a certain value], tuck it under this card. | `WHEN ACTIVATED` | These birds eat other birds. Look at the wingspan of the top card of the deck and compare it to their hunting power. If the wingspan of the top card in the deck is less than the bird's hunting power, tuck that card to signify that your predator hunted successfully. Each tucked card is worth 1 point at the end of the game. If the wingspan of the top card is equal to or larger than your predator's power, discard the card instead. |

## Dice-Based Fishing

These birds roll dice to determine if they successfully catch fish.

| Bird(s) | Power | Trigger | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|
| Anhinga, Black Skimmer, Common Merganser, Snowy Egret, White-faced Ibis, Willet | Roll all dice not in the birdfeeder. If any are fish, gain 1 fish and cache it on this card. | `WHEN ACTIVATED` | Birds that eat rodents or fish roll all dice that are not in the birdfeeder. (Note that you will never roll more than 4 dice, because when all 5 dice are out of the birdfeeder it must reset immediately.) Roll dice on the table; they do not go back into the birdfeeder. If one or more dice show the specific food type, take at most 1 token of that type from the supply and cache it on your card. Each token on a bird card is worth 1 point at the end of the game. |
