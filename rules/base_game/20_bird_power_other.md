# Bird Powers: Other Special Powers

This document details various other special bird powers that don't fit into the main categories.

## Habitat Movement

These birds can move between habitats under certain conditions.

| Bird(s) | Power | Trigger | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|
| Bewick's Wren, Blue Grosbeak, Chimney Swift, Common Nighthawk, Lincoln's Sparrow, Song Sparrow, White-crowned Sparrow, Yellow-breasted Chat | If this bird is to the right of all other birds in its habitat, you may move it to another habitat. | `WHEN ACTIVATED` | These birds are all able to live in a variety of habitats, and they have the power to move from habitat to habitat—but only if they're the last bird in that row. (They can be in any column.) This can be powerful for increasing your abilities in multiple habitats, and for scoring on end-of-round goals. Be careful not to play another bird to the right of one of these cards, or you won't be able to use its power! |

## Power Repetition

These birds can repeat the powers of other birds in the same habitat.

| Bird(s) | Power | Trigger | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|
| Gray Catbird, Northern Mockingbird | Repeat a brown power on one other bird in this habitat. | `WHEN ACTIVATED` | A few birds have the power to repeat another bird's brown power. The repeated bird must be in the same habitat. |
| Hooded Merganser | Repeat one "once between turns" power in this habitat. | `WHEN ACTIVATED` | The repeated bird must be in the same habitat. |

## Bonus Card Drawing

These birds allow you to draw additional bonus cards.

| Bird(s) | Power | Trigger | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|
| Atlantic Puffin, Bell's Vireo, California Condor, Cassin's Finch, Cerulean Warbler, Chestnut-collared Longspur, Greater Prairie-Chicken, King Rail, Painted Bunting, Red-cockaded Woodpecker, Roseate Spoonbill, Spotted Owl, Sprague's Pipit, Whooping Crane, Wood Stork | Draw 2 new bonus cards and keep 1. | `WHEN PLAYED` | Draw two goal cards, pick the one you want to keep, and discard the other. If the deck of goal cards is ever exhausted, shuffle the discards to form a new face-down deck. The birds with this power are all threatened or endangered, or conservationists are concerned that they soon will be because of a declining trend in their population. |

## Playing a Second Bird

These birds allow you to play an additional bird in the same habitat.

| Bird(s) | Power | Trigger | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|
| Downy Woodpecker, Eastern Bluebird, Great Blue Heron, Great Egret, House Wren, Mountain Bluebird, Red-eyed Vireo, Ruby-crowned Kinglet, Savannah Sparrow, Tufted Titmouse | Play a second bird in your [specific habitat]. Pay its normal cost. | `WHEN PLAYED` | Play another bird into the same habitat. You must follow all other rules about how to play birds: it must be a bird that has that habitat, and you must discard the food and egg cost for that bird. The birds with this power all are known for spending time in mixed flocks with multiple bird species. Research has shown this can have benefits such as help finding food and being alerted about predators. |
