# Edge Cases and Frequently Asked Questions

This document addresses common edge cases and clarifications for Wingspan rules.

## Birdfeeder Management

**Q: What happens if the birdfeeder is empty when I need to gain food?**
A: If the birdfeeder tray is ever empty, throw all 5 dice back into the birdfeeder to refill it.

**Q: What if all dice in the birdfeeder show the same face?**
A: If all the dice in the tray all show the same face (including if there is only 1 die) and you are about to gain food for any reason, you may first throw all 5 dice back into the birdfeeder. Each die counts as its own unique face for this purpose.

**Q: Can I use a die showing the invertebrate/seed side or the dual side?**
A: Yes. In general, if a power says to gain a food from the birdfeeder, you can use a die showing either the invertebrate side or the dual side. The same applies to seeds.

## Food and Resource Conversions

**Q: Can I exchange food when playing a bird?**
A: Yes. When playing a bird, you may exchange any 2 food tokens for 1 food token that you need.

**Q: Can I use the bonus conversions (card-to-food, food-to-egg, egg-to-card) multiple times?**
A: No. Each bonus conversion can only be used once per action. You can discard a maximum of 1 bird card for 1 additional food, pay a maximum of 1 food for 1 additional egg, or discard a maximum of 1 egg for 1 additional card.

**Q: Is there a limit to the food or egg supply?**
A: The supply of food tokens is not intended to be limited. If you ever run out, see the rules on gaining food for instructions on how to replenish the supply. There is no limit to the egg supply.

## Playing Birds

**Q: Can I play a bird if I don't have the required food?**
A: No. You must be able to pay the full food cost and egg cost to play a bird.

**Q: If a bird shows multiple habitats, which one do I place it in?**
A: You may choose which of the shown habitats to place the bird in.

**Q: Can I play more than 5 birds in a habitat?**
A: No. Each habitat row has a maximum capacity of 5 birds.

**Q: What if I need to discard eggs to play a bird but I haven't laid any eggs yet?**
A: You cannot play a bird in columns 2-5 if you do not have the required number of eggs to discard.

## Bird Powers

**Q: Do "WHEN PLAYED" powers activate every turn?**
A: No. "WHEN PLAYED" powers only activate once, when the bird is first played from your hand.

**Q: Do I have to activate brown "WHEN ACTIVATED" powers?**
A: The rules state you activate powers "you wish" from right to left, suggesting activation is optional.

**Q: Can I activate brown powers in any order?**
A: No. Brown powers must be activated from right to left (from the rightmost bird to the leftmost bird in the habitat row).

**Q: If multiple players have pink "ONCE BETWEEN TURNS" powers triggered by the same action, what order do they resolve?**
A: They resolve in turn order, starting with the player to the left of the active player.

**Q: Can a bird that moves into a habitat using its power trigger "ONCE BETWEEN TURNS" powers?**
A: No. A bird that uses its power to move into a habitat does not trigger "once between turns" powers that activate when a bird is played in that habitat.

## Eggs and Nest Types

**Q: Can I exceed a bird's egg limit?**
A: No. You cannot place more eggs on a bird than its egg limit allows.

**Q: Do star nests count for all nest types?**
A: Yes. Star nests are wild and can be used as all of the nest types for goals and bonus cards.

**Q: Can I use a bird with a star nest for multiple powers that require specific nests in the same turn?**
A: Yes. If you have different powers that are looking for specific nests, a bird with a star nest can be used with all of them, even within one turn.

## Card Drawing

**Q: Is there a hand limit?**
A: No. There is no limit to the number of bird cards you can have in your hand.

**Q: When are face-up cards on the bird tray replenished?**
A: Face-up cards are refilled only at the end of your turn. At the end of each round, all face-up cards are discarded and replaced with 3 new cards.

## End-of-Round Goals

**Q: What if I score 0 on an end-of-round goal?**
A: You must still place an action cube on the goal board, even if you score 0 points.

**Q: How are ties handled on the green side of the goal board?**
A: Ties are split by adding the values of the tied places and dividing by the number of tied players, rounded down. For example, if two players tie for 1st, they each get (5+2)/2 = 3.5, rounded down to 3 points. No 2nd place is awarded.

**Q: Must I have at least one of the targeted item to score on the blue side?**
A: Yes. You must have at least 1 of the targeted item to score on the blue side of the goal board.

## Bonus Cards

**Q: When are bonus cards scored?**
A: Bonus cards are scored at the end of the game during final scoring.

**Q: For the "Ecologist" bonus card, what if all my habitats are tied for fewest birds?**
A: You may still score this bonus. For example, if all of your habitats have 3 birds in them, your habitat with the fewest birds has 3 birds in it.

**Q: For wingspan-related bonus cards, do birds with exactly the specified wingspan count?**
A: For "Large Bird Specialist," wingspans of exactly 65cm do NOT count. For "Passerine Specialist," wingspans of exactly 30cm DO count.

## Caching and Tucking

**Q: Can I spend cached food?**
A: No. Once a food token is cached on a bird card, you cannot spend it.

**Q: What if I run out of food tokens when caching?**
A: If you run out of food tokens, you can cache cards instead.

**Q: Are tucked cards worth points?**
A: Yes. Each tucked card is worth 1 point at the end of the game.

## Hunting and Fishing

**Q: What happens to the dice after I roll them for hunting/fishing powers?**
A: Roll the dice on the table; they do not go back into the birdfeeder.

**Q: How many dice do I roll for hunting/fishing powers?**
A: Roll all dice that are not currently in the birdfeeder. Note that you will never roll more than 4 dice, because when all 5 dice are out of the birdfeeder, it must reset immediately.

**Q: For wingspan-based hunting, what happens if the top card's wingspan equals my predator's power?**
A: If the wingspan is equal to or larger than your predator's power, discard the card instead of tucking it.
