# Timing and Priority Rules

This document clarifies the timing and priority of effects in Wingspan, particularly when multiple effects trigger simultaneously.

## Turn Structure and Action Resolution

When a player takes an action, the following sequence occurs:

1.  **Place Action Cube:** The player places an action cube on the leftmost exposed slot in the chosen habitat row.
2.  **Gain Base Benefit:** The player immediately gains the benefit shown on that action slot.
3.  **Activate Brown Powers:** If the action is Gain Food, Lay Eggs, or Draw Cards, the player moves the action cube from right to left, activating brown "WHEN ACTIVATED" powers in sequence.

## Pink Power Priority and Timing

Pink "ONCE BETWEEN TURNS" powers are activated on an opponent's turn. The key detail is *when* they activate.

**The activation of a pink power is immediate, directly following the event that triggers it.** This can interrupt the active player's turn. [1]

### Activation Sequence

The general sequence is as follows:

1.  The active player takes an action (e.g., activates a brown power).
2.  This action triggers an opponent's pink power.
3.  The active player **pauses** their turn.
4.  The player with the pink power resolves it immediately.
5.  The active player then **resumes** their turn (e.g., continues activating their remaining brown powers).

For example, if Player A has a Black Vulture ("when another player's predator power succeeds, gain 1 food") and Player B (the active player) activates a predator that succeeds, Player A immediately gains 1 food from the birdfeeder. This happens *before* Player B activates any other brown powers to the left of their predator. This could impact Player B if Player A takes the last of a certain food type from the birdfeeder. [2]

### Powers with "At the End of the Turn"

Some pink powers explicitly state that they activate "at the end of that player's turn." In these cases, the power does not interrupt the active player. Instead, all such powers are resolved after the active player has fully completed their turn, including activating all of their brown powers. [2]

### Multiple Pink Powers

When multiple players have pink powers triggered by the same action:

1.  Powers are resolved in **turn order**.
2.  Start with the player to the **left of the active player**.
3.  Continue clockwise around the table.

## Other Timing Rules

- **"When Played" Power Timing:** "WHEN PLAYED" powers activate **immediately** after the bird is placed on the player mat, before any other actions are taken.
- **Face-Up Card Replenishment:** Face-up cards on the bird tray are **not immediately replaced** when drawn. They are only replenished at the **end of the active player's turn**.
- **Birdfeeder Reset Timing:** The birdfeeder is reset **before** a player gains food if it is empty or all dice show the same face.
